4. Other destinations to accept mail for: This defines the mail destinations that this Postfix instance will accept. If you need to add any other domains that this server will be responsible for receiving, add those here, otherwise, the default should work fine.
5. Force synchronous pilih NO
6. Local networks: This is a list of the networks that your mail server is configured to relay messages for. The default should work for most scenarios. If you choose to modify it, make sure to be very restrictive in regards to the network range.

# Untuk atur ulang konfigurasi
sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix

# tweak
# set home_mailbox = Maildir
sudo postconf -e 'home_mailbox= Maildir/'

# set the location virtual_alias_maps table = /etc/postfix/virtual. :
sudo postconf -e 'virtual_alias_maps= hash:/etc/postfix/virtual'

# Map Mail Addresses to Linux Accounts
sudo nano /etc/postfix/virtual

The virtual alias map table uses a very simple format. On the left, you can list any addresses that you wish to accept email for. Afterwards, separated by whitespace, enter the Linux user you'd like that mail delivered to.

For example, if you would like to accept email at contact@example.com and admin@example.com and would like to have those emails delivered to the sammy Linux user, you could set up your file like this:

example:
Isi dari : /etc/postfix/virtual
    contact@example.com sammy
    admin@example.com sammy
