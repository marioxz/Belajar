# install phpmyadmin
sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-gettext

#    For the server selection, choose apache2.
#    Select yes when asked whether to use dbconfig-common to set up the database
#    You will be prompted for your database administrator's password
#    You will then be asked to choose and confirm a password for the phpMyAdmin application itself

# The installation process actually adds the phpMyAdmin Apache configuration file into the /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/ directory, where it is automatically read.
# The only thing we need to do is explicitly enable the PHP mcrypt and mbstring extensions, which we can do by typing:
sudo phpenmod mcrypt
sudo phpenmod mbstring

# optional
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
# tambah di paling bawah
Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

# restart
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo service apache2 restart
