sudo apt install ufw


sudo nano /etc/default/ufw
# ubah : IPV6=yes

sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# To configure your server to allow incoming SSH connections
sudo ufw allow ssh

# This will create firewall rules that will allow all connections on port 22, 
# which is the port that the SSH daemon listens on by default. 
# UFW knows what SSH and a number of other service names mean because they're listed as services in the /etc/services file.
sudo ufw allow 22

sudo ufw allow 2222

# Enabling UFW
sudo ufw enable

# Allowing Other Connections
# example
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
# or
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443

# example port and protocol type
sudo ufw allow ftp
sudo ufw allow 21/tcp

# Specific Port Ranges
sudo ufw allow 6000:6007/tcp
sudo ufw allow 6000:6007/udp

# with port
sudo ufw allow from 15.15.15.0/24 to any port 22

# Connections to a Specific Network Interface
# look interface
ip addr
# if your server has a public network interface called eth0, you could allow HTTP traffic (port 80) 
# to it with this command:
sudo ufw allow in on eth0 to any port 80

# if you want your MySQL database server (port 3306) to listen for connections on the private network interface eth1, 
# for example, you could use this command:
sudo ufw allow in on eth1 to any port 3306

# Denying Connections
sudo ufw deny http
sudo ufw deny from 15.15.15.51
